         <h4>A LITTLE ABOUT ME:</h4>
         <p>My name is Anna Helene Sæthre, and I'm 21 years old! 
            I was born and raised in Brønnøysund in Helgeland 
            and lived there until I moved to Bergen to study 
            in 2021. To give you some background on my education, 
            I started with Health and Social Studies in the first 
            year of high school. In the second year, I switched to 
            ICT (Information and Communication Technology), 
            where I was introduced to the vast world of IT, 
            especially programming. We had a development subject 
            where some classmates and I ended up creating a 
            youth company to build a website for a local 
            business! It was an extremely educational and 
            exciting experience, and I already knew back 
            then that this was the path I wanted to pursue. 
            Therefore, in my third year, I took additional 
            courses to obtain a general study competence so 
            that I could apply for higher education.
        </p>
        <p>I took a year off to work and save money before 
            starting my studies. During this time, I worked 
            at Coop Mega, Coop Prix (grocery store chains), 
            and as an assistant at a nursing home. 
            This experience helped me develop excellent 
            adaptability and strong communication skills 
            when interacting with people. In the summer 
            of 2021, I was accepted into Frontend Development 
            at Noroff in Bergen, and I moved there to start 
            a new chapter in my life! Throughout my education 
            at Noroff, I have worked on various exciting 
            projects using pre-existing APIs provided by 
            the school. This has given me a good idea of 
            what it would potentially be like to collaborate 
            with actual clients.
        </p>
        <p>In January 2022, I took on my first project with a 
            client, where I developed a website for their 
            business. You can find it under the "Projects" 
            section!
        </p>
        <p>I just completed my final exam, and the title 
            of Junior Frontend Developer is right around 
            the corner. Now, I'm on the hunt for a 
            job where I can showcase my skills and 
            still have the opportunity to continuously 
            develop myself. One of the best things 
            about this education is that you never 
            stop learning!</p>
        <h4>ON A PERSONAL NOTE:</h4>
        <p>If I'm not sitting behind the screen coding, 
            you can find me at the gym or out in nature! 
            I love exercising, whether it's outdoors or 
            indoors, and it gives me an extra boost of 
            energy in my daily life. Earlier this year, 
            I actually ran a half marathon here in Bergen 
            for the first time, and it was quite 
            an experience!
